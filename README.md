# devproxy

## Overview
 
Tired of reconfiguring your tools when being connected and disconnected frequently from your corporate intranet with a mandatory proxy server? 
Just point your tools to devproxy and switch the proxy target dependent on environment, and never reconfigure your proxy again.

In direct mode the proxy directly breaks out to the internet, in chaining mode the proxy connects to upstream corporate proxies 
with authentication.

## Credentials

`devproxy cred` set and encrypt passwords for the corporate proxy 

## Running

`devproxy auto` connect to whatever environment is available either direct or indirect

## Direct

`devproxy direct` 

## Proxy Chaining

`devproxy chain`
